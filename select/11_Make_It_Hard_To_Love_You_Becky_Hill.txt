The moment that I met you I could tell
That you had been in the dark
You had a broken heart
But now you need to get over yourself
I know that you're feeling low
But just know

Love isn't easy
You're so in your head
You gotta believe me
Every word that I said
I'll be here no matter what
You're never alone
But there's only so much I can do
To let you know

My heart is open wide
God knows I really tried
But you make it hard to love you
Why'd you make it hard to love you?
You ain't lettin' me inside
So I'm letting go tonight
'Cause you make it hard to love you
Why'd you make it hard to love you?

(Make it hard to love you
Make it hard to love you, you
Make it hard to love you, you
Make it hard to love you, you)

Seeing how you're asking me for help
If you wanna get through the hurt
You gotta do the work
So now you gotta save yourself
I know that you're feeling low
But just know

Love isn't easy
You're so in your head
You gotta believe me
Every word that I said (Every word that I said)
I'll be here no matter what
You're never alone (Never alone)
But there's only so much I can do
To let you know

My heart is open wide
God knows I really tried
But you make it hard to love you (So hard)
Why'd you make it hard to love you? (So hard)
You ain't lettin' me inside
So I'm letting go tonight (Letting go tonight)
'Cause you make it hard to love you
Why'd you make it hard to love you?

You been hurt before
But let your guard down
Let me in your heart now
Baby, we could be so much more
If you let your guard down
I ain't letting you down

I ain't letting you down now
But you make it hard to love you
And I try and I try
But you make it hard to love you
So

My heart is open wide
God knows I really tried
But you make it hard to love you (So hard)
Why'd you make it hard to love you? (So hard)
You ain't lettin' me inside
So I'm letting go tonight (Letting go tonight)
'Cause you make it hard to love you
Why'd you make it hard to love you?

You been hurt before
But let your guard down
Let me in your heart now
Baby, we could be so much more
If you let your guard down
I ain't letting you down
