Ha ha ha
Tell me why when you look me in the eye
Why do I feel like I want to die
I've been at work all day in the pouring rain
Just to give you something you'll forget
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love
And I don't know why after all this time
Every single song I sing is about you
And you walk away, you just walk away
But I still make your bed
And you still leave me for dead
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love
And I would never hate you, but you're hard to love
And I would never leave you, but you're hard to love
