# BLACKPINK – Hard to Love

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Ain’t no magic tool to fix it
You should keep your distance
I’m only telling you
because I care
‘Cause I’m hard to love
Find it hard to trust
When it feels too good
I just **** it up
You want all of me
I can’t give that much
So don’t fall too hard
‘Cause I’m hard to love
(I’m hard to love, yeah)
(I’m hard to love)
Never meant to cause
you a problem
Here I am, yet once
again with the same old story
You don’t see the issues,
I got ’em
Yeah, I do, yeah, it’s true
I’ll make it feel like heaven
But I swear, I’m not a saint
And you won’t see the truth
‘Cause I’ll be kissing it away
Yeah I’ll be all you
need until I’m
driving you insane
Baby, all I’m trying
to do is save you the pain
‘Cause I’m hard to love
Find it hard to trust
When it feels too good
I just **** it up
You want all of me
I can’t give that much
So don’t fall too hard
‘Cause I’m hard to love
(I’m hard to love, yeah)
(Hard to love)
Up till I’m down
I’m all in till I’m out
Got a lot to work out
Till it’s all behind me
You know you don’t
Play with fire in the dark
Protect your heart
Ain’t no going back
once you start
I’m trying to be nice
(I’m hard to love, yeah)
(Hard to love)
